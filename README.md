# Hierarchical-Attention-Network
Implementation of an RNN with attention mechanism for rating prediction.

The implementation is based on [**Hierarchical Attention Networks for Document Classification**](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~diyiy/docs/naacl16.pdf) paper by Yang et al 2016. Richard Liao's [blog](https://richliao.github.io/supervised/classification/2016/12/26/textclassifier-HATN/) was helpful in coming up with this implementation.
